# OpenReply — self-hosted Docker image
#
# Two runtime processes ship from this image:
#   - web:    `npm run start`  → next start (needs .next + node_modules)
#   - worker: `npm run worker` → tsx worker/dm-worker.ts (runs RAW TypeScript,
#             not a bundled output — needs the generated Prisma client, the
#             full source tree under lib/ and worker/, and tsconfig.json for
#             the `@/*` path alias tsx resolves at runtime)
#   - cron:   `sh scripts/cron.sh` → the scheduler for /api/cron, which nothing
#             runs off Vercel (see docs/deploy-dokploy.md). It needs scripts/
#             in the image and wget on PATH; node:20-slim ships neither.
#
# next.config.ts does not set `output: "standalone"`, so `next start` already
# requires the full node_modules tree at runtime — there is no slimmer
# standalone bundle to fall back to here. Given that, this Dockerfile does
# NOT try to strip node_modules/tsconfig.json/source files out of the final
# stage: doing so is exactly what breaks the worker (MODULE_NOT_FOUND on
# `@/lib/...` imports, because tsx has no tsconfig to resolve the alias
# against, and no app/generated/prisma to import from).

# Default to the web process. Which npm script runs is selected by the PROCESS
# env var, so a single image serves both roles without the host having to
# override the command: hosts like Railway ignore railway.json's startCommand
# on CLI-uploaded deploys and expose no CLI setting for it, but they do let you
# set env vars. Set PROCESS=worker on the worker service.
